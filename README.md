## gigranger.com - A Employment Platformüßë‚Äçüíº

A full-featured job portal application that allows recruiters to post and manage job listings, and job seekers to find, apply, and track job applications, it also allows chat communication between them. This project showcases real-world features such as authentication, role-based access, file uploads, filtering, email notifications, and application history tracking ‚Äî built with production-ready technologies.

## üìå Disclaimer

This app began as a personal initiative to practice and explore full-stack development concepts using modern tools like React, Node.js, MySQL, and AWS. While it may not follow a single strict standard across all components ‚Äî for instance, some forms use Dialogs while others use Formik, and error handling varies between Axios responses and `console.error` ‚Äî this was intentional.

The goal has always been to build a progressively enhanced application while experimenting with different patterns, tools, and technologies. As it evolved, I incorporated more real-world features such as file uploads, email notifications, realtime chat, role-based access control, protected routes, and application history.

I plan to continue improving it with technologies like RabbitMQ, Docker Containerization, and more advanced patterns. This app is meant to be a learning-driven, functional foundation of a job portal, reflecting growth, curiosity, and hands-on problem solving.

So don‚Äôt judge it by perfection üòÑ

### ‚úÖ Deployment Stack

| Component | Details |

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Frontend** | React app hosted on **AWS S3** and served via **CloudFront** with custom domain and HTTPS (`gigranger.com`) |

| **Subdomain Redirect** | `www.gigranger.com` redirects to the root domain using **S3 redirect + CloudFront** |

| **Backend API** | Node.js + Express app deployed to **Elastic Beanstalk** (single-instance, no load balancer), reverse-proxied with **Nginx + Let's Encrypt SSL** at `api.gigranger.com` |

| **Database** | **AWS RDS** using **MySQL** |

## üìÑ Resume Upload Feature

This project includes a file upload functionality for user resumes, which supports **both local storage (for development)** and **Amazon S3 storage (for production)**.

### üîÅ Automatic Storage Mode Detection

The app automatically switches between **local disk storage** and **S3 cloud storage** depending on the environment configuration:

| Environment | Storage Method | Trigger |

| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

| Development | Local (project folder) | No `S3_BUCKET_NAME` defined in `.env` |

| Production | Amazon S3 | `S3_BUCKET_NAME` is defined in `.env` |

---

### üìÇ Local Storage (Development)

- Files are saved under:

`backend/uploads/resumes/`

- Accessible during development via:

`http://localhost:4000/uploads/resumes/<filename>`

- Ensure the following line is active in `app.js`:

```js
app.use(
  '/uploads/resumes',

  express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads/resumes'))
);
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon S3 Storage (Production)

When the application is deployed in production and the environment is properly configured, resumes are uploaded to **Amazon S3** instead of being stored locally.

- Files are saved inside the `resumes/` folder within your S3 bucket.

- The uploaded file is publicly accessible using the returned S3 URL.

- Example of a stored file URL:

`https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/resumes/123456-resume.pdf`

To enable S3 uploads, ensure the following environment variables are defined in your `.env.production`:

| Variable | Description |

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your AWS access key |

| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS secret access key |

| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region (e.g., `us-east-2`) |

| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | Your S3 bucket name |

If any of these are missing, the app will **automatically fallback to local storage**.

## üì¶ Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a **Component-Driven Development (CDD)** approach, emphasizing separation of concerns:

- **Services** handle all API communication (e.g., `JobService`, `AuthService`).

- **Hooks** (e.g., `useJobCategories`, `useAuth`) encapsulate logic and data fetching.

- **Components** like tables, dialogs, and form inputs focus on UI rendering.

- **Pages** use these building blocks to compose full features.

This modular pattern improves reusability, testing, and clarity across the UI codebase.
