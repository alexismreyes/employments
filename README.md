## gigranger.com - A Employment Platformüßë‚Äçüíº

A full-featured job portal application that allows recruiters to post and manage job listings, and job seekers to find, apply, and track job applications, it also allows chat communication between them. This project showcases real-world features such as authentication, role-based access, file uploads, filtering, email notifications, and application history tracking ‚Äî built with production-ready technologies.

## üß© Installation Guide

You can now run the entire application using Docker without needing to install Node.js, MySQL, or any local dependencies ‚Äî everything runs in containers.

1.  **Clone the Repository**

> git clone https://github.com/alexismreyes/gigranger.com.git <br>
> cd gigranger.com

2.  **Configure Environment Files**

    Create three files:

- `./backend/.env.development`
- `./frontend/.env.development`
- `./email-service/.env`

Use the sample variables shown in the [üîê Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section below to configure them.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
>
> - Use a real email address to receive application notifications. All preloaded users in the database use the password `123456789`.
>
> - Use the MySQL username and password defined in the /database/init.sql file, or create your own credentials ‚Äî just make sure to update them accordingly in the same file.
>   <br><br>

3.  **Run the App Using Docker**

_üêß For Linux/macOS:_

Use the provided Makefile:

    make run         # Start all containers
    make stop        # Stop containers (keep data)
    make reset       # Remove everything and reinitialize from SQL dump
    make rebuild     # Full clean + rebuild + launch

_ü™ü For Windows:_

Use the interactive script:

    manage.bat

This script will show a menu with options to run, stop, reset, or rebuild the app using Docker Compose.

### Notes on Database Initialization

- The database will be automatically created and seeded using the included `employment_db.sql` file included within the database folder.
- You do **not** need to import the SQL file manually.
- Data is persisted across runs using Docker volumes depending the option you choose from the make file or manage.bat file.
- Running a full reset (`make reset` or option 3 in `manage.bat`) will wipe all data and reload the schema from `employment_db.sql`.

‚úÖ Use .env.production files for deployment, replacing localhost URLs with actual production domains or IPs.

## üê≥ Dockerized Microservices

As of the latest version, the app has been modularized using a microservices approach. Two new containers have been added, one dedicated to RabbitMQ message broker and one Node.js email microservice container:

| Container Name            | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gigranger-frontend`      | React frontend                                           |
| `gigranger-backend`       | Node.js + Express backend API                            |
| `gigranger-database`      | MySQL instance with init + seed                          |
| `rabbitmq`                | RabbitMQ message broker with management UI               |
| `gigranger-email-service` | Node-based microservice that processes queued email jobs |

These containers are orchestrated using Docker Compose. All communication between services (e.g., backend ‚Üí RabbitMQ ‚Üí email-service) is handled asynchronously.

## üìÑ Resume Upload Feature Details

As mentioned above, this project includes a file upload functionality for user resumes, which supports **both local storage (for development)** and **Amazon S3 storage (for production)**.

### üîÅ Automatic Storage Mode Detection

The app automatically switches between **local disk storage** and **S3 cloud storage** depending on the environment configuration:

| Environment | Storage Method         | Trigger                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Development | Local (project folder) | No `S3_BUCKET_NAME` defined in `.env` |
| Production  | Amazon S3              | `S3_BUCKET_NAME` is defined in `.env` |

### üìÇ Local Storage (Development)

- Files are saved under:

`backend/uploads/resumes/`

- Ensure the following line is active in `app.js`:

```js
app.use(
  '/uploads/resumes',

  express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads/resumes'))
);
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon S3 Storage (Production)

When the application is deployed in production and the environment is properly configured, resumes are uploaded to **Amazon S3** instead of being stored locally.

- Files are saved inside the `resumes/` folder within your S3 bucket.

- The uploaded file is publicly accessible using the returned S3 URL.

- Example of a stored file URL:

`https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/resumes/123456-resume.pdf`

To enable S3 uploads, ensure the following environment variables are defined in your `.env.production`:

| Variable                | Description                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | Your AWS access key            |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS secret access key     |
| `AWS_REGION`            | AWS region (e.g., `us-east-2`) |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME`        | Your S3 bucket name            |

If any of these are missing, the app will **automatically fallback to local storage**.

## üì¶ Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a **Component-Driven Development (CDD)** approach, emphasizing separation of concerns:

- **Services** handle all API communication (e.g., `JobService`, `AuthService`).

- **Hooks** (e.g., `useJobCategories`, `useAuth`) encapsulate logic and data fetching.

- **Components** like tables, dialogs, and form inputs focus on UI rendering.

- **Pages** use these building blocks to compose full features.

This modular pattern improves reusability, testing, and clarity across the UI codebase.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Architecture

The backend is structured following **Modular API Design** principles using Express and Sequelize. This design allows for scalability, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

- **Controllers** handle business logic for each domain (e.g., `authController`, `jobController`, `chatController`).

- **Models** define Sequelize schemas and represent database tables (e.g., `User`, `Job`, `ChatMessage`).

- **Routes** map HTTP endpoints to controller methods (e.g., `jobRoute`, `authRoute`, `chatRoute`).

- **Middlewares** manage authentication, validation, error handling, and other reusable logic (e.g., `verifyToken`).

- **Sockets** enable real-time features like live chat using Socket.IO. Includes logic for joining rooms, broadcasting messages, and notifying users.

- **Utils** and **Services** provide shared utilities (e.g., email sending with Nodemailer, file uploads with Multer, or S3 integration).

- **Test** folder contains backend unit/integration tests using **Jest** and **Supertest**.

This backend structure supports full API lifecycle management ‚Äî from secure user authentication to real-time communication ‚Äî and enables feature scaling through modular service expansion (e.g., microservices or background jobs).

## üìå Disclaimer

This app began as a personal initiative to practice and explore full-stack development concepts using modern tools like React, Node.js, MySQL, and AWS. While it may not follow a single strict standard across all components ‚Äî for instance, some forms use Dialogs while others use Formik, and error handling varies between Axios responses and `console.error` ‚Äî this was intentional.

The goal has always been to build a progressively enhanced application while experimenting with different patterns, tools, and technologies. As it evolved, I incorporated more real-world features such as file uploads, email notifications, realtime chat, role-based access control, protected routes, and application history.

I plan to continue improving it with technologies like RabbitMQ, Docker Containerization, and more advanced patterns. This app is meant to be a learning-driven, functional foundation of a job portal, reflecting growth, curiosity, and hands-on problem solving.

So don‚Äôt judge it by perfection üòÑ
